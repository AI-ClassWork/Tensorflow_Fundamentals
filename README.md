# Tensorflow_Fundamentals
In this notebook, we're going to cover some of the most fundamental concets of tensor using tensorflow
More specifically, we're going to cover: introduction to tensors, info from tensors, manipluating tensors, tensors and numpy, using @tf.function ( a way to speed up your regular python functions) using GPUs with tensorflow (or TPUs)
